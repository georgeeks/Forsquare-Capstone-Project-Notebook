## Methodology, Tools and Techniques  

### Method: 
- Geotagging
- Multiclass Classsification
- Clustering  
 
### Methodology:
   - Understanding investor intention - prerequisite
   - Understanding the importance of optimal conditions of the localities - prerequisite
   - Defining a large area - the city, the country
   - Establishing the layers according to the investor criteria
       - areas with heavy pedestrian traffic like large intersections, malls, markets etc. Foursquare request  
       - hospitals, existing clinics. Foursquare request
       - pharmacies in the area. Foursquare request
       - operating hours. Foursquare request
   - Data Exploration, Feature engineering for optimal definition of features (criteria)
   - Classification of layers  
   - Clustering according to criteria
       - of traffic
       - of distance
           - proximity - hospitals, markets
           - away - existing pharmacies
