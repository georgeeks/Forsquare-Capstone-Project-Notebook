## Business overview
Pharmacies are together with hospitals and medical clinics, essential institutions for the health of the population. In addition to the social good, pharmacies are also a successful business.
We have been approached by a new pharma investor to present an optimal solution for the placement of 10 new pharmacies in a European capital.  

## Task overview  
Our task is to propose the optimal locations  
We have chosen as optimal the points that satisfy the following requirements, in the following order of importance:
### Main criteria:
- Neighborhood of hospitals or medical clinics
- Neighborhood of malls or areas with high pedestrian traffic
- The greatest distance from the existing pharmacies
### Secondary criteria:
- Neighborhood of public transport
- Hours of operation of public locations in the area
